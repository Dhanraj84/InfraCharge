⚡ InfraCharge – Intelligent EV Charging Infrastructure Platform

InfraCharge is a data-driven platform designed to improve how EV users find charging stations and how planners decide where new stations should be built.
It combines real-time maps, AI-based demand insights, and environmental analysis to support smarter EV mobility and infrastructure planning.

🚀 What Problem Does It Solve?

EV adoption is growing, but charging infrastructure is still uneven and hard to navigate.

InfraCharge helps:

EV users quickly find nearby charging stations

Reduce range anxiety with smarter route planning

Identify underserved areas with low charging availability

Support data-backed decisions for new station deployment

Promote sustainable travel through CO₂ comparisons

🧠 How It Works

The platform uses geospatial data and basic AI logic to analyze:

Traffic density and vehicle movement

Existing charging station distribution

Demand patterns and infrastructure gaps

Nearby amenities and accessibility

Weather and environmental factors

This enables practical, data-driven suggestions instead of guess-based planning.
